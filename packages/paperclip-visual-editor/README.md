⚠️ note -- need to build tooling out of necessity. Will create
UI around that.


TODOS:

- [ ] box-model controls (margin & padding sizing)
- [ ] zoom in & out
- [ ] abiliy to change font (from file system)
- [ ] ability to change colors
- [ ] measurement tools
- [ ] grid tools
- [ ] possibly using doc-comments to add metadata about screens
