⚠️ note -- need to build tooling out of necessity. Will create
UI around that.

TODOS:

- [ ] Grid view of all components in project directory
- [ ] should be able to define frames (good for mobile views & such)
- [ ] linting (should be wired up with linting lib)
  - [ ] warning when there's a magic color


Nice to haves:

- [ ] display computed CSS of selected elements in right panel (chrome-like inspector)
