The [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.paperclip) enables you to visually create your Paperclip files in realtime. It also comes with other tooling such as color pickers, autocompletion, and error highlighting.

After installing the extension, create a new PC file & open it up - you should be prompted to show a live preview. You can also preview `*.pc` files by running the `Paperclip: Open Live Preview` command (can be opened via `cmd + shift + p`)

### Inspecting the preview window

If you want to use the web inspector in VS Code to see how UIs, just run `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`. 

### Crashes

You may run into a few bugs during Alpha that could cause the extension to crash. If that happens, run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
