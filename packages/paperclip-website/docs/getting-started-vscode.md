The [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.paperclip-vscode) is a really good place to start since it works out of the box. Just create a new `hello-world.pc` file, and start writing plain HTML & CSS. Play around by creating a style block, use the color pickers.  Get a real good feel for Paperclip.

### Tips

- To **Open a live preview**, execute the `Paperclip: Live Preview` while a `*.pc` file is open.
- To **zoom**, scroll & hold down the `meta` / `ctrl` key.
- To **measure between elements**, just select an element, then hold `meta` / `ctrl` by hovering over another element.
- You can **turn off visual tools** by clicking the raindrop. 
- You can open the **web inspector** by running the command: `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`.
- If the extension stops working for whatever reason (might happen during Alpha), then run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
