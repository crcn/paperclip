You'll want the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.paperclip-vscode) extension since it has realtime previews, and other tools like color pickers, autocompletion, and such.

After installing the extension, I'd recommend just playing around with it by creating a new `hello-world.pc` file & writing HTML.  Play around by creating a style block, use the color pickers.  Get a real good feel for the app.

Here are some tips:

- You can open any preview with the command: `Paperclip: Open Live Preview`.
- You can open the web inspector by running the command: `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`.
- If the extension stops working for whatever reason (might happen during Alpha), then run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
