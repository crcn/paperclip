The [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.paperclip-vscode) is a really good place to start since it works out of the box. Just create a new `hello-world.pc` file, and start writing plain HTML & CSS. Play around by creating a style block, use the color pickers.  Get a real good feel for Paperclip.

#### Here are some tips:

- You can open any preview with the command: `Paperclip: Open Live Preview`.
- You can open the web inspector by running the command: `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`.
- If the extension stops working for whatever reason (might happen during Alpha), then run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
