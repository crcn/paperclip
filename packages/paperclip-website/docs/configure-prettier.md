Assuming that you have [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) installed, just run:

```
yarn add prettier-plugin-paperclip --dev
```

After that you should be good to go! Just be sure that prettier is configured to pick up `*.pc`. 

Also note that this package is still very new so there aren't any options outside of what Prettier provides (tab size, max columns). If you think this module is missing a feature, please feel free to [submit a feature request](https://github.com/crcn/paperclip/issues/new)!
