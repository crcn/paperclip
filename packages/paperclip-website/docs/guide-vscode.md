### Tips

- To **Open a live preview**, execute the `Paperclip: Live Preview` while a `*.pc` file is open.
- To **zoom**, scroll & hold down the `meta` / `ctrl` key.
- To **measure between elements**, just select an element, then hold `meta` / `ctrl` by hovering over another element.
- You can **turn off visual tools** by clicking the raindrop. 
- You can open the **web inspector** by running the command: `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`.
- If the extension stops working for whatever reason (might happen during Alpha), then run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
