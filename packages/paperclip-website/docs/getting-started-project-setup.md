Before you can start using Paperclip in your application, you _may_ need to do some manual configuration. If you're starting from fresh, you can simply use the Paperclip CLI tool to automatically generate project files. That might be a good place to start if you're looking to kick around the tires. 

#### New Project

If you're starting from scratch, the easiest thing to do is run:

```
mkdir my-project && cd my-project && npx paperclip init
```

‚òù This will create a new project for you. After that, you can just run:

```
npm start
```

#### Vanilla JS
