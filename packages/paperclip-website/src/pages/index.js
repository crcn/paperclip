            - no more broken window CSS - feeling confident that CSS changes won't break
            - A kind-of type system for CSS changes

              {/* Paperclip is a template language specifically designed around visual development. This allows for a hybrid approach to building UIs
          that's faster */}
              {/* Nothing sucks more than waiting around for your browser to see CSS changes. With Paperclip there's none of that - just open up the live preview

              Web development is slow & CSS tends to become unmanageable over
              time, especially as projects & teams become larger. Paperclip
              helps with that by providing you with tooling to manage visual
              changes, keep CSS scoped, and a visual editor for creating UIs in
              realtime.
              {/* UI development is visual, and tooling should reflect that. Paperclip */}
