** Need to wait for a few weeks to let current bugs shake out **

#### Re-do website

- make it beta only
- UI for grid view


#### Next

- get dev server to work again
- wire up dev server with vscode - deprecate IPC
- get vscode to check for dev server lock - use that
- pop tab out of vscode 

- grid view!
  - show all UIs

#### Considerations

- Grid view
- grid view frame performance? 
- needs to be a standalone app
- expose RPC server for updating docs
- allow for remote http preview
- update vscode extension to use PC server
- PC server should emit screenshots? Maybe live? Should be performant?
- show frames with components
- re-use for QA?
