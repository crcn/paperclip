  - show all UIs

- key combos
  - cmd + t = show grid

- ability to hide gutter

- *need to consider file modifications
  - make read-only until connected with text editor?
    - maybe not considering that user might be using plain text editor

- consider FS changes

#### Considerations

- Grid view
- grid view frame performance? 
- needs to be a standalone app
- expose RPC server for updating docs
- allow for remote http preview
- update vscode extension to use PC server
- PC server should emit screenshots? Maybe live? Should be performant?
- show frames with components
- re-use for QA?
