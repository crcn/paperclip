### Overall

- birds eye view
  - renderer for all PC files
    - possibly sub process that takes screenshot
  - multiple tabs
  - filter by tags metadata

### Immediate

- ensure frames can be changed if comments don't exist (add tests)
- ability to copy & paste frames
- ability to delete frames
- update percy scanner
- trim whitespace at end of document
- select elements based on text position
- z index for title needs to be 1024

### problems

- frames in the way
- URI protocol not working - need to update frame renderer

### Maybe

- js strings allow escape characters
- preset sizes
- multi-select windows
- ability to hide frames
- ability to expand frames
