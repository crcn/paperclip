The _ultimate_ goal for Paperclip is to have a language geared for designers around creatingÂ user interfaces
that can safely be integrated into code. Another way to think of the languge is basically a file format that just _looks_ like code. 

## Why not HTML & CSS

#### HTML & CSS doesn't map well to designer tools

The primary issue lies around CSS selectors. For example:

```html
<style>

</style>
```
#### HTML & CSS contains missing features

#### Cascading styles is a footgun

## A slimmed down version of HTML & CSS

#### Limted CSS functionality

_Since_ the paperclip UI editor would be geared more towards designers, there'd need to be a limited set of CSS features. This means:

#### native HTML elements as components
