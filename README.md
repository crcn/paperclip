Paperclip is DSL that provides a hybrid approach to building UIs that allows you to design & code in parallel. It focuses _purely_ on the visual aspect of your app - just HTML, CSS, and primitive components, and compile directly into React code (more targets to come). 

Here's a demo if Paperclip in action:

![demo 2021-01-22 10_24_37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757408/105437454-13b1b900-5c9c-11eb-8754-3769658180a1.gif)


Here's the UI file for the clip above:

```html

<!--
  @frame { visible: false }
-->
<h4 export component as="FormTitle">
  
  <!-- Styles defined within elements are scoped, and don't need selectors -->  
  <style>
    margin: 0px;
  </style>
  {children}
</h4>

<!--
  @frame { visible: false }
-->

<!-- Note this would typically be defined in a separate file & imported into this doc -->
<input export component as="TextInput" {placeholder?} {type}>
  <style>
    border: 1px solid rgb(156, 156, 156);
    padding: 8px 16px;
    border-radius: 2px;
  </style>
</input>


<!--
  @frame { visible: false }
-->
<div export component as="FormFooter">  
  <style>
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;
  </style>
  {children}
</div>


<!--
  @frame { visible: false }
-->

<!-- This typically wouldn't be defined here -->
<button export component as="Button">
  <style>
    --button-bg-color: rgb(116, 176, 255);
    background: var(--button-bg-color);
    color: rgb(46, 85, 136);
    padding: 8px 16px;
    border-radius: 2px;
    border: 2px solid var(--button-bg-color);
  </style>
  {children}
</button>


<!--
  @frame { visible: false }
-->
<div export component as="AuthModal">
  <style>
    display: grid;
    grid-row-gap: 16px;
    max-width: 250px;
    margin: 0px auto;

    /* rule of thirds */
    top: 30%;
    padding: 32px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    color: rgb(97, 97, 97);
    background: rgb(238, 238, 238);
    position: relative;
    border: 1px solid rgb(194, 194, 194);
  </style>
  {children}
</div>


<!--
  @frame { visible: false, title: "Auth / login", width: 586, height: 446, x: 3, y: 141 }
-->
<div export component as="Preview">
  <style>
    font-family: sans-serif;
    height: 100vh;
  </style>
  

  {showLogin && <AuthModal>
    <FormTitle>Log in</FormTitle>
    <TextInput placeholder="Username">

    </TextInput>
    <TextInput placeholder="Password">

    </TextInput>
    <FormFooter>
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
    </FormFooter>
  </AuthModal>}

  {showSignup && <AuthModal>
    <FormTitle>Sign up</FormTitle>
    <TextInput placeholder="Full Name">

    </TextInput>
    <TextInput placeholder="Username">

    </TextInput>
    <TextInput placeholder="Password">

    </TextInput>
    <TextInput placeholder="Repeat Password">

    </TextInput>
    <FormFooter>
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
    </FormFooter>
  </AuthModal>}
</div>



<!--
  @frame { title: "Auth / Login", width: 501, height: 427, x: 0, y: 0 }
-->
<Preview showLogin />


<!--
  @frame { title: "Auth / Sign Up", width: 501, height: 561, x: 581, y: 1 }
-->
<Preview showSignup />
```

Here's how you integrate Paperclip into your code:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import * as styles from "./auth.pc";
import { TextInput } from "@design-system/components/TextInput";
import { Button } from "@design-system/components/Button";

export const LoginPage = () => {

  const { onSubmit, usernameInputProps, passwordInputProps } = useLogin();
  const userNameProps = useTextInput();

  return <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <styles.Modal>
      <styles.AuthModal> 
        <styles.FormTitle>Welcome back!</auth.FormTitle>
        <TextInput type="text" {...usernameInputProps} />
        <TextInput type="password" {...passwordInputProps} />
        <styles.FormFooter>
          <Button>Log in</Button>
        </styles.FormFooter>
      </styles.AuthModal>
    </styles.Modal>
  </form>;
};
```

#### Why did you build this?

I felt there was a better approach to building UIs that involved an experience that's closer to what
designers have, but without losing the fidelity that engineers need. A _purely_ visual design doesn't quite cut it for engineers,
and the current state of front-end tooling kind of sucks. So, I built something in-between that I think gets the job done nicely. üëå

Why isn't HMR enough? It's not really a canvas where you can draw & see your result immediately, and I find the lag time to be an absolute concentration killer, especially as projects grow in scale - HMR also gets slower, _much_ slower. 

Paperclip's engine is built on top of Rust and designed to handle large projects, so you don't ever have to wait around your previews to refresh - it just happens in realtime (as I think it should). It's actually much more of a joy to work with, and I'm finding myself saying "yes" more to designers when they ask for features, instead of cutting corners.

Visual regression testing, style maintainence, and cross-browser testing are a few other areas I wanted to make easier, so that's all baked into Paperclip's design as well. 


#### What are some features of the DSL?

- No global CSS - everything's explicit so you never run into leaky styles.
- Sass-like syntax: nested selectors, mixins, etc.
- Generalized for multiple compile targets. Currently works with React, but other languages & frameworks are planned.
- No lock-in. Swap in and out any similar libraries (styled-components, emotion, etc)

### What can you do with the designer?

- Measure between elements just like Figma.
- Meta + select visual elements to reveal source code.
- Create different sized frames for responsive testing.
- Share your workspace with others & for cross-browser testing.
- Browserstack integration - launch instance directly from designer.
- Grid view of all of your project UIs so that you can visually find what you're looking for.

### What does the IDE extension come equipt with?

- CSS fixings: auto-complete, color pickers, and more.
- meta + click elements to reveal source code.
- realtime updates between the designer & code.

### What are some other neat Paperclip features?

- Super easy visual regression coverage - just plug in Percy, point to Paperclip files, and you're good to go.

# Roadmap

Here's a peek at what's planned for Paperclip:

- Multiple compiler targets so that you can re-use your Paperclip UIs in different languages & frameworks
- Extension for Atom, Sublime, and other editors
- Storybook integration
- More visual editing tools so that you don't have to write code. Possibly more designer-friendly tooling.
- A11Y & other linting stools
- Code splitting so that you don't need to include all of your CSS into one bundle
