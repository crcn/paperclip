# Build UIs in real-time ‚ö°Ô∏è

<!-- No more juggling between the coding & debugging in the browser. Paperclip provides tooling that allows  -->

Paperclip is a template language that's designed for creating primitive UI components visually, directly within VS Code.

<!-- Tooling is provided that brings a real-time preview of your application directly into your code editor. -->

<!-- Paperclip is a template language that runs while you're writing in it, so you can see a preview of exactly what you're creating in real-time. -->

<!-- No more wasted time juggling between the browser & code! -->


<!-- Paperclip code runs while you're writing it, so you never have to leave the IDE. UI files also compile down directly to React code. -->

<!-- Write your UIs and see a live preview of them directly within your IDE. Paperclip templates also compile to React code, so you can use them in your React app.  -->

## Motivation 

<!-- TODO: more pain point here -->

The motivation behind Paperclip is to eliminate bottlenecks around HTML & CSS development, and provide tooling that helps you ship UI features quicker. More specifically:

- Eliminate the lag time between writing code & seeing UI.
- Shorten the gap between design -> code by bringing more design tooling into web development.
- Provide better safety around building UIs with easier to use cross-browser testing tools. 

## Features ‚ú®

- Works out of the box. Just download the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.paperclip-vscode-extension) and start typing away. 
- Previews are powered by a low-level runtime, so your changes appear instantly, and won't slow down as your project scales.
- Templates can be compiled to strongly typed code.
- Templates Integrate with your existing React application (more languages & frameworks soon).
- Integrates with Webpack. 



## What does a template look like?

Paperclip just covers basic HTML, CSS, and syntax for defining _dumb_ components. Here's an example:

```html
<!-- todo-list.pc -->

<!--
Styles are scoped to this file, so you don't have to worry about them leaking out.
-->

<style>
  * {
    font-family: Helvetica;
  }

  ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  
  li[data-done] {
    text-decoration: line-through;
  }
</style>

<!-- Parts are building blocks that are individually used in application code (more information below). -->
<part id="TodoItem">

  <!-- You can assign attribute bindings. -->
  <li data-done={done}>
    <input type="checkbox" checked={done} onClick={onDoneClick}>

    <!-- You can also define slots where text & elements are inserted into. -->
    {label}
  </li>
</part>

<part id="TodoList">
  <h1>Todos:</h1>
  <input type="text" onKeyPress={onNewTodoKeyPress} placeholder="Add a new todo..." >
  <ul>
    {todoItems}
  </ul>
</part>

<!-- Preview is a special tag for development that allows you to see how all of your parts look when put together in their varying states. -->
<preview>
  <TodoList todoItems={<>
    <TodoItem label="Feed cat" done />
    <TodoItem label="Take out trash" />
    <TodoItem label="Walk dog" done />
  </>} />
</preview>
```

> ‚òùüèªThis example uses just about all of the features that Paperclip has to offer. No logic, just syntax for describing how your UI looks. 

The `<part />` elements expose the component's building blocks. These blocks are used in JavaScript code. More on that below üëáüèª.

Here's what you see in VS Code as you type away:

![Simple todo preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/757408/75791302-ff866580-5d31-11ea-8da9-1c43631f0626.gif)


## How do I add logic? 

Templates compile directly to highly optimized code. If you remember the `<part />` elements above, those are exported as building blocks that we can use to create a functional component: 

<!-- Using our list example above, here's how you might use it in a React app: -->

```javascript

// <part /> elements are exposed as React components.
import { TodoList, TodoItem } from "./list.pc";
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    { label: "Clean car" },
    { label: "Eat food", done: true },
    { label: "Sell car" }
  ]);

  const onNewInputKeyPress = (event) => {
    if (event.key === "Enter" && value) {
      setTodos([...todos, { label: event.target.value }]);
      event.target.value = "";
    }
  };

  const onDoneClick = (todo: Todo) => {
    setTodos(
      todos.map(oldTodo => {
        return oldTodo.id === todo.id
          ? {
              ...oldTodo,
              done: !oldTodo.done
            }
          : oldTodo;
      })
    );
  };

  // The attribute bindings & slots that were defined are
  // exposed as props for each <part /> component.
  return (
    <TodoList
      onNewTodoKeyPress={onNewInputKeyPress}
      todoItems={todos.map(todo => {
        return (
          <TodoItem
            done={todo.done}
            onDoneClick={() => onDoneClick(todo)}
            label={todo.label}
            key={todo.id}
          />
        );
      })}
    />
  );
};
```

> The code for this example is also [here](./examples/react-simple-todo-list).

> More compiler targets are planned for other languages and frameworks. React is just a starting point ‚úåüèª.

As you can see, `<part />` elements are exported as _dumb_ components that React can use. From there we can combine all parts with logic to create a functional component. That's the gist of Paperclip!

<!-- 
As you might have noticed, Paperclip just exports building blocks for your component. All of the logic remains in your application code, so you don't have to worry about  -->

## Strongly typed ü¶∫

Templates compile down to strongly typed code, so you don't have to guess about what your templates need. Here's a generated TypesScript definition of our React app above:

```typescript
import {ReactNode, ReactHTML, Factory, InputHTMLAttributes, ClassAttributes} from "react";

type ElementProps = InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & ClassAttributes<HTMLInputElement>;

export declare const styled: (tag: keyof ReactHTML | Factory<ElementProps>, defaultProps?: ElementProps) => Factory<ElementProps>;

type TodoItemProps = {
  done: String | boolean | Number | Object | ReactNode,
  onDoneClick: Function,
  label: String | boolean | Number | Object | ReactNode,
};

export const TodoItem: Factory<TodoItemProps>;

type TodoListProps = {
  onNewTodoKeyPress: Function,
  todoItems: String | boolean | Number | Object | ReactNode,
};

export const TodoList: Factory<TodoListProps>;
```

<!-- ### What makes Paperclip special?

Paperclip's syntax allows you to express _most_ of you user interface in a "dumb" way. -->


<!-- The current process around developing UIs is incredibly slow, especially as codebases scale. Paperclip was created -->


<!--UI development is a bit slow & inneficient, especially as projects scale, and code complexity kicks in. So I developed Paperclip to be a lightweight, and fast alternative for creating UIs that helps get the job done faster. 

The template language is limited -->

<!--

Points:

- lightwight
- bones of the UI

## Roadmap üåÑ

This is just the beginning! Here are just a few planned features:

- Zero-setup automated visual regression testing. Just plug in your Paperclip files.
- More compiler targets: Ruby, PHP, VueJS, AngularJS, and others.
- More code editor integrations: Sublime, Atom.
- More visual tooling in the preview, so you can make visual changes directly.
- Preview against different browsers directly within your code editor.
