A template language designed for visual development.

### Features

- **No global CSS** - Paperclip removes global CSS in favor of scoped styles.
- **Realtime visual editing** - Open up the paperclip dev server and see your UIs update in realtime _as you're writing code_.
- **Visual regression testing** - All Paperclip UI files are automatically covered for visual regression testing.
- **Browserstack integration** - launch any UI in Browserstack, directly from Paperclip.
- **No lock-in** - You can easily move away from Paperclip if you want to. I'd even wager that it's faster to build UIs in Paperclip _first_, then translate to something else. 
- **compiles to plain code** - Just import `*.pc` files into your app and use them like render functions.
- **No runtime libraries** - Paperclip comes with a CLI tool and webpack loader that compiles Paperclip UIs into plain code.
- **SASS-like syntax** - Paperclip supports some sass-like features such as mixins, & nested rules. 
- **Rich VS Code experience** - Intellisense, color pickers, autocomplete, and more.
- **Zeplin integration** - (Experimental) sync design tokens to your project & use them in Paperclip UIs.
- **Birds-eye view** - see of your UIs

# Example

Here's a basic Paperclip UI file:

```html
<!-- Scoped styles here -->
<style>
  ol {
    padding-left: 1em;
    font-family: Open Sans;
  }
  li {
    margin-top: 6px;
  }
</style>

<!-- Components exported to code -->

<ol export component as="List">
  {children}
</ol>

<li export component as="ListItem">
  {children}
</li>

<!-- Preview of UI -->

<List>
  <ListItem>Something</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Something</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Something</ListItem>
</List>
```

‚òùüèª Here's how you can import this file in React code:

```jsx
import * as styles from "./styles.pc";

function GroceryList() {

  const groceries = [
    "Milk ü•õ", 
    "Water üíß", 
    "Taco seasoning üåÆ"
  ];

  return <styles.List>
    {
      groceries.map(item => (
        <styles.ListItem>{item}</styles.ListItem>;
      ))
    }
  </styles.List>;  
}
```

# Roadmap

Here's a peek at what's planned for Paperclip:

- Multiple compiler targets so that you can re-use your Paperclip UIs in different languages & frameworks
- Extension for Atom, Sublime, and other editors
- Storybook integration
- More visual editing tools so that you don't have to write code. Possibly more designer-friendly tooling.
- A11Y & other linting stools
- Code splitting so that you don't need to include all of your CSS into one bundle
